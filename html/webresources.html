<a href="https://kissflow.com/application-development/how-to-create-a-web-application/#how-to-build-web-app">Kissflow.com</a><br />
Kissflow.com is a multifaceted website that has resources for developing and deploying web applications.<br />
<br/>
While this website as a whole is a fantastic resource for professionaly developers (I assume), the main reason I selected it for a spot on this assignment is the breakdown of the steps of creating a web app. It's very easy to get overwhelmed with the amount of imformation thrown at us and tasks we need to complete, so looking back to a 12 step plan can bring things into perspective. Difficulty on individual steps might be a hurdle to work over, but the overall process is concise.<br />

<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">CodeAcademy.com</a><br />
Code Academy is a website that has articles, videos, and interactive tutorials..<br />
<br/>
Code academy is an incredible resource that can be used as a refresher on core concepts such as basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I can forget things easily especially bouncing between so many different languages and programs, having a consistent tool to look back on is invaluable.<br />

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools.com</a><br />
W3Schools is a tutorial website and resource for coding, especially helpful for the basics and has extensive sections on intermediate concepts as well.<br />
<br/>
W3Schools is a website dedicated to breaking down the basics of coding, which makes it a very useful resource for a beginner. Even still, I have returned to this website on more than one occasion to refresh myself while working on more complex issues only to find the answers as a simple solution in beginning type of problems. It's example problems are typically not as helpful as the information in the breakdowns.<br />

    <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSStricks.com</a><br/>
    CSStricks is a website dedicated to elaborating on how to write better, easier CSS.<br/>
    <br/>
    CSStricks has articles, templates, guides, videos and everything else you would expect from a website with a simple title like CSS tricks. It has tricks for CSS but also functions as a repository of general information on the language which can be extremely helpful in the future for designing or formatting a web app.

    Rating: 4/5 because I'm terrible at CSS.

    <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen.io</a><br/>
    Codepen is a collaborative website that essentially functions as a "leetcode for frontend" developers.<br/>
    <br/>
    This website has challenges for CSS, HTML, Javascript, collaborative forums, a build in editor. This could be invaluable going forward to improving personal skills in front end development as some people work better in a group environment or being able to bounce off the attempts of themselves and others when its available to them.
